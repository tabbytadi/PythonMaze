# Maze Solving Program

This project is a simple maze-solving program implemented using Python's Turtle graphics library. The goal is to visualize the solving process of a maze using two algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

## Features

- Visual representation of the maze.
- Solution visualization using Turtle graphics.
- Implementation of DFS and BFS algorithms to find the path from start to end.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `turtle` graphics library, which is included in Pythonâ€™s standard library.

## Setup

Clone the repository and run the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tabbytadi/maze-solving-program.git
cd maze-solving-program
python maze_solver.py
